C++ file to my adventure game

This game started out from a tutorial question that was to make a random monster generator. I've added the to the file to create a game out of it.

- The game is turn based style
- You choose between a knight, wizard or ranger class
- Each class has different hit points and attack range 
- When you beat 3 Monsters (exclude level 1 to 2) you will level up, which increases your hit points and attack range
- You start off with all 3 items (attack, defense and health potion) with the chance of monsters dropping more

I used classes to create the monsters and the characters player. Your inventory is held in a vector. The monsters will generate randomly and will increase in difficulty  as the player levels up.
